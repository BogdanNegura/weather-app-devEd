### This Project is intended for those who are looking on creating their first projects using javascript or you might be here from freecodecamp with their javascript weather app project.

### We are going to be using darksky api to pull all the necessary weather information you need. Darksky can be used free for up to 1000 api calls, so it is great for a demo project.
